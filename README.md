Assignment: Informatics 573 — UNIX Shell Scripting Assignment

Description:-
This script automates the process of downloading and analyzing secondary assemblies of human chromosome 1 from the UCSC Genome Browser. It was designed to be fully independent, so a user can simply run it on any bash-compatible system without manually performing the tasks.
The workflow includes:
Navigating to the user’s home directory.
Creating a working directory called Informatics_573.
Downloading all chromosome 1 assemblies except the primary reference file chr1.fa.gz.
Extracting (gunzip) the downloaded files.
Creating a results file: data_summary.txt.
Appending detailed file information (name, size, permissions).
Appending the first 10 lines of each assembly.
Appending assembly names with their total line counts.

Files Included:-
informtics_573.sh
Main shell script that executes all required tasks.
data_summary.txt
Output file generated by the script, containing file metadata, sample contents, and line counts.

Requirements:-
The script is written in Bash and requires the following tools (all available by default in most Linux systems):
wget → to download chromosome files.
gunzip → to unzip .fa.gz files.
ls, stat, wc, head → standard UNIX commands for file operations.

Instructions to Run:-
Clone or download this repository.
git clone <your_repo_link>
cd <your_repo_folder>
Make the script executable:
chmod +x informtics_573.sh
Run the script:
./informtics_573.sh
 After execution, check the generated file:
cat ~/Informatics_573/data_summary.txt

Expected Output Files:-
When the script is successfully executed, the following will be created:
Informatics_573/ directory in the home folder.
All chromosome 1 secondary assemblies (downloaded and unzipped).
data_summary.txt file containing:
File names, sizes, and permissions.
First 10 lines of each chromosome file.
File name and total number of lines per file.

Notes:-
The script is designed to exclude the main chr1.fa.gz file and only download secondary assemblies.
Tested on SLES 15 SP3 (Quartz HPC, IU) but should work on any Linux or macOS system with bash, wget, and gunzip.
If running on macOS, ensure Homebrew or another package manager provides wget.
